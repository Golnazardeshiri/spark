/**
 * Allocates a pool of memory to task threads for use in shuffle operations. Each disk-spilling
 * collection (ExternalAppendOnlyMap or ExternalSorter) used by these tasks can acquire memory
 * from this pool and release it as it spills data out. When a task ends, all its memory will be
 * released by the Executor.
 *
 * This class tries to ensure that each thread gets a reasonable share of memory, instead of some
 * thread ramping up to a large amount first and then causing others to spill to disk repeatedly.
 * If there are N threads, it ensures that each thread can acquire at least 1 / 2N of the memory
 * before it has to spill, and at most 1 / N. Because N varies dynamically, we keep track of the
 * set of active threads and redo the calculations of 1 / 2N and 1 / N in waiting threads whenever
 * this set changes. This is all done by synchronizing access on "this" to mutate state and using
 * wait() and notifyAll() to signal changes.
