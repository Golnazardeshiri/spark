/**
 * A set of columns representing a list of values of type dataType.
 *
 * For simplicity, we key all the columns using strings that represent the path to that field
 * inside dataType; for example, for a struct(x, struct(y, z)), we might have columns named
 * "0.data" for x, "1.0.data" for y and "1.1.data" for z. Some data types might require multiple
 * columns, e.g. both a "data" and "length" for lists. Technically this encoding with string
 * names is not needed, but it makes the code easier for now.
 *
 * TODO: Might want an additional map saying which fields are dictionary-encoded, though that can
 * also be inferred from the columns we generate from them.
